  <h1>BiouBrain</h1>
  <p>A student-led initiative looking to foster knowledge of neuroscience in youth and children. Active projects include Brain Bee study resources and the Journal Club. </p>

  <h2>About</h2>

<p>Biou (Greek); duration of life, the medium by which life is sustained. 
</p>

<p>BiouBrain started out as an initiative to help youth around the world gain access to neuroscience resources, and was originally intended to be shared with a goal of increasing youth opportunities in neuroscience in mind. 
  This led to an initiative under BiouBrain to further progress in production of early-stage resources and help make learning about Neuroscience more accessible.

<h3>Danielle Choi:
</h3>

<p>"Hello! My name is Danielle Choi, and I am currently a sophomore at Glenelg Country School. 
  Coming from a military family with a blend of Japanese and Korean heritage has exposed me to a wide variety of perspectives that constantly influence the way I view the world. 
  As a result, I love to analyze the interplay between our thoughts and cultures through different aspects: the intricate mechanisms of neuroscience and the creative expression of literature. 
  If I do not have my face buried in a book, you can find me playing the flute or painting with Bob Ross tutorials."

<h3>Jolin Cheng:
</h3>

<p>"Hi! I’m Jolin, and I’m currently a junior in North Carolina. 
  I’m super passionate about the sciences and am so excited about BiouBrain (you totally should too! ;))!"
</p>

<h3>Gurleen Hans: 
</h3> 

  <p>"Hi, my name is Gurleen Hans! 
  As a high schooler, I often struggled to find neuroscience-related initiatives or extracurriculars in my hometown. 
  As a result, I looked for as many online opportunities as possible and got started. 
  Some of my first neuroscience-related extracurriculars included the NeuroSci101 Lecture Series and Toronto Brain Bee by the UofT CPIN. 
  I also did some extracurriculars with the IYNA, including writing a featured article on general information about dendritic spines and later went on to do the IYNA summer program. 
  In Neuroscience I of the summer program was where I first met the co-founders of BiouBrain and the initiative started up! I am currently in my first year studying Life Sciences at the University of Toronto. 
  To be honest, I'm guilty of not having very many hobbies! I enjoy lifting weights and spending time in nature, and I'm a bit of a plant mom. 
  I like math and anything related to it and know a bit of computer science from my high school classes. 
  I am a total beginner in Simulation Neuroscience topics and want to learn more! 
  I love the Dune movies and rewatch them constantly, and right now I am reading a bit of the first Dune book!"

# Bioubrain

A student-led initiative looking to foster knowledge of neuroscience in youth and children. Active projects include Brain Bee study resources and the Journal Club. 


## About

Biou (Greek); duration of life, the medium by which life is sustained. 

BiouBrain started out as an initiative to help youth around the world gain access to neuroscience resources, and was originally intended to be shared with a goal of increasing youth opportunities in neuroscience in mind. This led to an initiative under BiouBrain to further progress in production of early-stage resources and help make learning about Neuroscience more accessible. 

## Team Member Bio's

### Danielle Choi:

"Hello! My name is Danielle Choi, and I am currently a sophomore at Glenelg Country School. Coming from a military family with a blend of Japanese and Korean heritage has exposed me to a wide variety of perspectives that constantly influence the way I view the world. As a result, I love to analyze the interplay between our thoughts and cultures through different aspects: the intricate mechanisms of neuroscience and the creative expression of literature. If I do not have my face buried in a book, you can find me playing the flute or painting with Bob Ross tutorials."

### Jolin Cheng:

"Hi! I’m Jolin, and I’m currently a junior in North Carolina. I’m super passionate about the sciences and am so excited about BiouBrain (you totally should too! ;))!"

### Gurleen Hans:  

"Hi, my name is Gurleen Hans! As a high schooler, I often struggled to find neuroscience-related initiatives or extracurriculars in my hometown. As a result, I looked for as many online opportunities as possible and got started. Some of my first neuroscience-related extracurriculars included the NeuroSci101 Lecture Series and Toronto Brain Bee by the UofT CPIN. I also did some extracurriculars with the IYNA, including writing a featured article on general information about dendritic spines and later went on to do the IYNA summer program. In Neuroscience I of the summer program was where I first met the co-founders of BiouBrain and the initiative started up! I am currently in my first year studying Life Sciences at the University of Toronto. To be honest, I'm guilty of not having very many hobbies! I enjoy lifting weights and spending time in nature, and I'm a bit of a plant mom. I like math and anything related to it and know a bit of computer science from my high school classes. I am a total beginner in Simulation Neuroscience topics and want to learn more! I love the Dune movies and rewatch them constantly, and right now I am reading a bit of the first Dune book!"

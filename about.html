    <h2>About</h2>

<p>Biou (Greek); duration of life, the medium by which life is sustained. 
</p>

<p>BiouBrain started out as an initiative to help youth around the world gain access to neuroscience resources, and was originally intended to be shared with a goal of increasing youth opportunities in neuroscience in mind. 
  This led to an initiative under BiouBrain to further progress in production of early-stage resources and help make learning about Neuroscience more accessible.
